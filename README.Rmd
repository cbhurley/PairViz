# PairViz

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PairViz is to improving graphics by ameliorating order effects, using Eulerian tours and Hamiltonian decompositions of  graphs.

## Installation

You can install the released version of PairViz from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r {r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("PairViz")
```

You will also need to install the graph package from Bioconductor.

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("graph")
```

To get started, check out the PairVizIntroduction vignette.
